/**
 * Problem 34:
 * 145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.
 *
 * Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.
 *
 * Note: as 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.
 *
 * 問題 34:
 * 145は面白い数である. 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145となる.
 *
 * 各桁の数の階乗の和が自分自身と一致するような数の和を求めよ.
 *
 * 注: 1! = 1 と 2! = 2 は総和に含めてはならない.
